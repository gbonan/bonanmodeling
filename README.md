Matlab code for [Climate Change and Terrestrial Ecosystem Modeling](http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/staff/bonan/ecomod/index.html) (2019, Cambridge University Press). 

Each directory is named for a supplemental program. The directory `sp_xx_yy` contains code for supplemental program `yy` in Chapter `xx`. The directory [`sp_02_01`](sp_02_01), for example, is the Matlab code for supplemental program 2.1 (Chapter 2, program 1). Each directory has a main Matlab program and may have additional files called by that program. For example, [`sp_02_01.m`](sp_02_01/sp_02_01.m) is the Matlab program for supplemental program 2.1 (there are no additional files). In Matlab, type `sp_02_01` to run the program. All directories are similarly structured, but may have additional files. In general, type `sp_xx_yy` to execute the programs.
